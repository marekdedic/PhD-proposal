\begin{itemize}
	\item Graph coarsening for efficient GNNs -- HARP based approach (\cite{dedic_balancing_2023, dedic_balancing_2024})
	\item Graph coarsening for efficient GNNs -- direct edge collapsing (\cite{prochazka_scalable_2022})
	\item Graph properties and their role in classification and its performance (\cite{prochazka_which_2023})
	\item Maybe something more recent with explainability?
\end{itemize}
