	abstract = {We present a method for graph node classification that allows a user to precisely select the resolution at which the graph in question should be simplified and through this provides a way of choosing a suitable point in the performance-complexity trade-off. The method is based on refining a reduced graph in a targeted way following the node classification confidence for particular nodes.},
